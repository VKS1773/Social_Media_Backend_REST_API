In this project I created some end points for user authenticationa and blog publishing
<br/>
<br/>
for user authentications I created 3 end points... get all user ,signup and login. I used bcrypt for password encrption
<br/>
for Blog publication I created 6 endpoints ...get all blogs ,addBlog,deleteBlog,UPdateBlog,getBlogByuserId,getBlog.

By using mongoose schema, two model (Blog and User) created and two router user-routes and blog-routes also created . where we use router from express
<br/>
<br/>
Two controller is also created (user-controller and blog controller)  where we create function for end point
